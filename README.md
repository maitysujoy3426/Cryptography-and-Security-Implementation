This repository includes C implementations of AES, ChaCha, Salsa, RC4, RSA, and primality tests like Miller–Rabin and Solovay-Strassen. It also contains sorting algorithms with Python-based performance comparisons. GMP is used for large-number support, with help from class materials and online resources.
