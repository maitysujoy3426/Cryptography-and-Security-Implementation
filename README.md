# Cryptographic-Implementations

This repository includes C implementations of AES, ChaCha, Salsa, RC4, RSA, and primality tests like Miller–Rabin and Solovay–Strassen.  
It also contains sorting algorithms with Python-based performance comparisons.  
GMP is used for large-number arithmetic, with guidance taken from class materials, classmates, and online resources.
